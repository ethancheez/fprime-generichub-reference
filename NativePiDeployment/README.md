# NativePiDeployment Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the NativePiDeployment Application

In order to build the NativePiDeployment application, or any other F´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd NativePiDeployment
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the NativePiDeployment application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd NativePiDeployment
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the NativePiDeployment app:
```
cd NativePiDeployment
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd NativePiDeployment/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./NativePiDeployment -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
